# Questions for the help session:

## Packages:

    Do I have to name the packages 'se.kth...' or may I use my own organisational name 'com.opers...'?

    Should I make model public within view, or should I re-route this?

    What is the opinion of public variables within classes? Should they be avoided? Do I need to re-do everything.
